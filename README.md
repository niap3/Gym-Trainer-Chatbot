# GYM TRAINER GPT
This is a Gym Trainer GPT Chatbot AI using open AI and Gradio.
### How we did it:
We used gradio and openAI's API to implement this chatbot. The user can send their messages inside the textbox and see the replies being generated on the left side.
First of all you need you aquire your openAI API key from your profile page in their website. Then add it into our codebase where it is specified. Later, you can use the chatbot without issues.

Initially, to run this yourself, do:

```
pip install gradio
```

```
pip install openai
```

Then, edit the codebase to add your personal key, then do:

```
python "filename"
```

This will generate a link in which you can run the chatbot.

Thank you ❤️
